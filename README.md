## What is this?

Source code for Reaktor junior developer assingment, spring 2021. Point of the assingment was to provide the (made up) client with an easy and fast website with a list of stock items by category.

There are three categories, **jackets**, **shirts** and **accessories**. Clicking on one of the category buttons on top of the page, the website will list you all the products in the corresponding category. 

After clicking one of the buttons, the information and listing data is stored in the browser, reducing unneccessary requests to the server. If the data was retrieved more than five minutes ago, clicking one of the category buttons retrieves the listing data again.

The project is running at www.placeholder.com, if you wanna check it out!
